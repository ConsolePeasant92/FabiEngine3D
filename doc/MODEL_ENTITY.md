# Model Entity

## 1. General

- The model entity is a (complex) 3D object in 3D space.
- A model entity cannot exist without having a mesh.
- A model entity uses a variety of textures for a more detailed mesh.
- Each model can be the parent of multipe AABBs.

## 2. Assets

- Mesh
- Diffuse map
- Emission map
- Specular map
- Reflection map
- Normal map
