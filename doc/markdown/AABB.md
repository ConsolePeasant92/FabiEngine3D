# AABB

## 1 General

- The AABB is a 3D cuboid in 3D space.
- The mesh of an AABB is generated by FabiEngine3D.
- AABB stands for "Axis Aligned Bounding Box".
- AABBs can only rotate with angles of 90&deg;.
- AABBs are used for collision and raycasting.
- AABBs can be bound to a parent (model/quad3D).
- Bound AABBs follow the transformation of their parent.
- Bound AABBs are invisible and unresponsive if their parent is invisible.
- Bound AABBs cannot directly be accessed or deleted.
