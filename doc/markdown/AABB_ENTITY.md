# AABB Entity

## 1 General

- The AABB entity is a 3D cuboid in 3D space.
- The mesh of an AABB entity is generated by FabiEngine3D.
- AABB stands for "Axis Aligned Bounding Box".
- AABB entities can only rotate with angles of 90&deg;.
- AABB entities are used for collision and raycasting.
- AABB Entities are invisible by default.
- AABB entities can be bound to a parent (model/quad3D entity).
- Bound AABB entities follow the transformation of their parent.
- Bound AABB entities are invisible when their parent is invisible.
- Bound AABB entities cannot directly be accessed or deleted.
