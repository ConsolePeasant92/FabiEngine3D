# Model Entity

## 1. General

- The model entity is a 3D object in 3D space.
- A variety of textures can be used for a more detailed mesh.
- Each model can be the parent of multipe AABB entities.
- If the mesh is multiparted, each part has its own properties.

## 2. Assets

- Mesh
- Diffuse map
- Emission map
- Specular map
- Reflection map
- Normal map
