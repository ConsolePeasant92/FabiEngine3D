# Model

## 1. General

- The model is a 3D object in 3D space.
- A variety of textures can be used for a more detailed mesh.
- Each model can be the parent of multipe AABBs.
- If the mesh is multiparted, each part has its own properties.
- Models can be rendered as another model to achieve level of detail.
- The instead rendered level of detail version uses the transformation and visibility of the main model.

## 2. Assets

- Mesh
- Diffuse map
- Emission map
- Specular map
- Reflection map
- Refraction map
- Normal map
