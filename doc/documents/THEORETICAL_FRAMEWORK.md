# Theoretical Framework

- **C++**: a powerful and fast programming language used a lot in game development.
- **OpenGL**: a library used for rendering 3D graphics.
- **SDL2**: a multimedia library that supports things like: window rendering, asset loading, keyboard input, etc.
- **Server**: a networking program that processes messages from networking clients.
- **Client**: a networking program that sends messages to a networking server.
- **TCP**: a networking protocol: Transmission Control Protocol.
- **UDP**: a networking protocol: User Datagram Protocol.
- **Translation**: this word is equal to "position".
- **Scaling**: this word is equal to "size".
- **Transformation**: the combination of translation, rotation, scaling.
- **Collision**: intersection between 2 things (example: between the camera and a model).
- **Raycasting**: the process of "casting" a ray (example: from the camera position towards where the camera is looking.
- **Wireframe**: the "skeleton" of a mesh; draws only the lines between vertices.
- **Mesh**: a collection of vertices that together make a 3D shape.
- **Model**: a 3D object in 3D space.
- **Billboard**: a 2D quad in 3D space.
- **AABB**: Axis Aligned Bounding Box; a 3D box used for collision.
- **LOD model**: Level Of Detail model; a less-detailed version of a model.
- **Camera**: everything in 3D space is looked at from a certain position (like filming with a camera).
- **Yaw**: the horizontal view angle of the camera (0 to 360 degrees).
- **Pitch**: the vertical view angle of the camera (-90 to 90 degrees).
- **Ambient lighting**: the overall brightness of a scene.
- **Directional lighting**: diffuse lighting based on a directional light source (example: the sun).
- **Point lighting**: individual light casters that show light around them (example: a torch).
- **Spot lighting**: a spot light casted from a position with a direction (example: a flashlight).
- **Specular lighting**: specular lighting is a light reflection from any light caster.
- **DOF**: Depth Of Field; a post-processing effect that blurs all non-focused pixels.
- **Motion blur**: pixels will be blurred in the motion direction of the camera.
- **SkyHDR**: an effect that affects the brightness of the sky based on the camera pitch angle.
- **Diffuse mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a model.
- **Cube mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a 3D cube map.
- **Billboard mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a billboard.
- **Image mapping**: using a texture to give a variety of colors to a GUI image.
- **Light mapping**: using a texture to make parts of a model brighter.
- **Reflection mapping**: using a texture to make parts of a model reflective.
- **Normal mapping**: using a texture to improve lighting effects on a model.
- **Height mapping**: using a texture to generate a terrain mesh.
- **Blend mapping**: using a texture to blend multiple textures together onto a terrain.
- **DUDV mapping**: using a texture to distort the texture of a water surface (example: water ripples).
- **Displacement mapping**: using a texture to create waves in the water mesh.
- **Flare mapping**: using a texture to achieve a lens flare effect when the camera is looking at a directional lighting caster.
- **Vertex**: a point (XYZ) in space within a 3D mesh.
- **UV coordinate**: a coordinate (XY) used for mapping 2D texture onto a 3D mesh.
- **Normal vector**: a normalized vector that points in the opposite direction of a surface; used for lighting calculations.
- **Fragment**: every pixel that canpossibly end up on your screen.
