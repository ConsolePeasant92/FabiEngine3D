# Billboard Entity

## 1. General

- The billboard entity is a 2D quad in 3D space.
- Instead of a solid quad, the texture of the billboard entity can be transparent text (based on a font).
- Billboard entities are not affected by shadows or lighting.
- Sprite animations can be applied to the diffuse/emission map.
- Each billboard is the parent of 1 AABB.

## 2. Assets

- Font
- Diffuse map
- Emission map
