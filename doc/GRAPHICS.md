## 1. Lighting

### 1.1 Ambient Lighting

- Ambient lighting is a form of global illumination.
- The lighting is not casted from a light source.
- Real world light scattering is mimicked.

### 1.2 Directional Lighting

- Directional lighting is light that comes from a directional light source.
- The light is only casted from a certain direction.
- Normal vectors are used to calculate this type of lighting.

### 1.3 Specular Lighting

- Specular lighting is light that is reflected from another light source.
- Normal vectors are used to calculate this type of lighting.

### 1.4 Point Lighting

- Point lighting is light that comes from a positional light source.
- The light is casted in every direction by the light source.
- Normal vectors are used to calculate this type of lighting.

### 1.5 Spot Lighting

- Spot lighting is light that comes from a rotational light source.
- The light creates a spotlight effect.
- Normal vectors are used to calculate this type of lighting.
