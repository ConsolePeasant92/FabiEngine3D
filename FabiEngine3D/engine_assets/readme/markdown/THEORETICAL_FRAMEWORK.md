# Theoretical Framework
- **Collision**: intersection between 2 things (for example: between the camera and a model).
- **Raycasting**: the process of "shooting" a ray from the camera position towards where the camera is looking.
- **Model**: a complex 3D object in 3D space, constisting of a mesh.

- **Billboard**: a 2D quad in 3D space.  
![billboard](../images/billboard.png)
- **AABB**: Axis Aligned Bounding Box, a 3D box used for collision.

- **LOD model**: Level Of Detail model, a less-detailed version of a model.

### Graphical Effects
- **Ambient lighting**: the overall lightness of a scene.  
![ambient_lighting](../images/ambient_light.png)
- **Directional lighting**: diffuse lighting based on a directional light source (for example: the sun).  
![directional_lighting](../images/directional_light.png)
- **Point lighting**: individual light casters that show light around them (for example: a torch).  
![point_lighting](../images/point_light.png)
- **Spot lighting**: a spot light casted from the camera position towards where the camera is looking (for example: a flashlight).

- **Specular lighting**: specular lighting is a light reflection from any light caster.

- **DOF**: Depth Of Field, a post-processing effect that blurs all non-focused pixels.

- **Fog**: the whole scene can have a foggy effect.

- **Shadows**: models can be shadowed for a more realistic scene.  
![shadows](../images/shadows.png)
- **Motion blur**: pixels will be blurred in the first person camera direction of motion.  
![motion_blur](../images/motion_blur.png)
- **Lens flare**: a post-processing flare overlay will be shown when the camera is looking at the directional lighting position (for example: the sun).

- **Sky HDR**: an effect that effects the brightness of the sky based on the camera pitch angle.
