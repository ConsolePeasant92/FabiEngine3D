![animation](FabiEngine3D/engine_assets/readme/animation_editor.png)
- You can **create/edit/delete** animations that can be applied to **models** with scripting or in the scene editor.
- You can select a **preview model** for the animation playback.
- An animation consists of 1 or more **keyframes**.
- Every keyframe has a different **target** transformation.
- Every keyframe has a different animation **speed**, with 2 types to choose from: **linear & exponential**.
- Rotational transformations can each have a different **rotation origin**.
- If the model has **multiple parts**, each part has its own transformation every keyframe.
- The **last** animation keyframe should be the same as the **initial** frame.
