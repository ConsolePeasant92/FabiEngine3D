## Introduction

FabiEngine3D is a game engine, created for simple 3D video games on PC. It contains various features such as: multithreaded asset management, 2D/3D rendering, mouse/keyboard input, 3D physics, 2D/3D audio, networking, custom scripting and an engine GUI to work with. The engine only uses one external library which is OpenGL (GLSL). FabiEngine3D is written in C++ and works only on Microsoft Windows. Why is it called FabiEngine you might ask? I named my game engine after my lovely wife Fabienne!

`Development started on April 7, 2020.`
