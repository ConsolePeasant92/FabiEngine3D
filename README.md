## Introduction

FabiEngine3D is a game engine, created for simple 3D video games on PC. It contains various features such as: multithreaded asset loading, 2D & 3D rendering, keyboard & mouse input, 3D physics, 2D & 3D audio, networking, custom scripting and an engine GUI to work with. The engine only uses 2 libraries: OpenGL 4.6 & SDL 2. It is written in C++20 and works only on Microsoft Windows. Why is it called FabiEngine you might ask? I named my game engine after my lovely wife Fabienne!
